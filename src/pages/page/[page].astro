				It was <b>October 2nd, 1998 in Kuwait City.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				Fahad stands at the window of his classroom, his gaze drifting over the bustling streets of Kuwait City. The sun cast a warm glow over the buildings, a stark contrast to the memories that haunted him from his childhood. The scars of war were still evident, as the city was slowly healing, just as he was.
				</p>
				He vividly remembers a time before the chaos, before the scars. "Life felt peaceful and full of promise," he thinks as he looks down at his arm solemnly remembering the trauma he endured. At the time he was but a schoolboy, just days away from the start of 5th grade, eager to play another season for his school's badminton team. Being one of the strongest members of his team he had been confident in his abilities but the afternoon of August 2nd,1990, that would all change.

			<h2>The Bombing.</h2>

				<p>
				“While having a joyful family gathering, the ground began to shake as we heard bombs and sirens overhead. Shortly after, the house came crashing down on us while we were eating" he recalled. It was a struggle to get out from under the bricks and rubble but the adrenaline in my body was so high that when we came out from the rubble, I hadn't even noticed that half my arm was missing until my mother ran up to me with concern and fear in her gaze. A shrapnel entered my arm during the bombing that night, leaving me permanently disabled. "In seconds, the life we knew was gone."
				</p>
				<p>
				The days that followed were a blur of fear and uncertainty. Our family was forced into a concentration camp. "We had no clean water, no clean clothes, no money," he remembered. We lived in a tent, while the war continued around us. There were no doctors, no support systems, and no access to prosthetics. As a child, I had to learn what it meant to live with a disability in the middle of a war zone.

			<h2>Going to College...</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				Now, as a college student, I have found ways to adapt. I can no longer play badminton so I decided the only way I could succeed was by focusing on my studies and hobby of tinkering with technology. I was often singled out, but Ayla, my childhood friend who was always like a sister to me, was always by my side.
				</p>
				<p>
				As of right now I am majoring in biochemistry, still trying to make my dreams of becoming a Neurosurgeon into a reality. With my amputated arm, I felt for a long time that these dreams were delusions. After tedious amounts of  research, I discovered that there is still hope for people like me when I found out a successful Orthopedic Surgeon in Kuwait was an amputee, and she became my inspiration. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Meanwhile, Ayla majored in Industrial and Operations Engineering, a blend of Business and Engineering, as she has a passion for both. One day, in her class, the professor invites a Biomedical Engineer to speak with the class about disability aid, that's when an idea sparked in Aylas head. She decides to make Fahad a prosthetic arm after realizing how hard it is for him to live without one, and that it could really help him out now that he has a closer accessibility to having one.

			<h2>Ayla wants to build a prosthetic...</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				Ayla, with the help from her professor, created a very rudimentary prosthetic using EMG (ElectroMyography). It was her first prosthetic, it could pick up cups and mugs. Ayla put blood, sweat, and tears into building this prosthetic. Unfortunately, it took a lot of trial and error for Ayla to custom fit to my stub. It also took a long time, as Ayla had to model and 3D print it multiple times. Ayla then presented this prosthetic to me. She was unsure when she showed me the prosthetic and told me that there was a risk to trying it on.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>
				CHOICE: Trust Ayla’s prosthetic? There is a small risk of nerve damage, if electricity flows back. She double checked the wires, multiple times, and got the ‘OK’ from the professor's friend…

				After further research, Ayla and I noticed that there are a lot of countries and people that struggle from the lack of aid devices being distributed to those areas. For example, we saw a statistic made from South Dakota State University, they stated that out of 40 million people only two million of them have prosthetics.  As someone who has personally gone through this, this touched me deeply. So, we both made it our mission to start a company and solve this issue.

			<p>Ana and Jin also noticed a few other differences between their work as well as the new promotion that Jin received.

			<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>Ana and Jin both decide to dive deeper into the promotion situation and how race and gender might affect one’s ability to receive a promotion. Upon researching, they find from the Harvard Business Review that:
				“Paradoxically, just when women are most likely to need sponsorship—as they shoot for the highest-level jobs—they may be least likely to get it. Women are still perceived as “risky” appointments for such roles by often male-dominated committees. In a study of top-performing CEOs, for instance, the women were nearly twice as likely as the men to have been hired from outside the company. That finding suggests that women are less likely to emerge as winners in their firms’ own CEO tournaments.”
				“Men and women alike say they get valuable career advice from their mentors, but it’s mostly men who describe being sponsored”
				“In 2008, 78% of men were actively mentored by a CEO or another senior executive, compared with 69% of women. More women than men had junior-level mentors: 7% of women were mentored by a nonmanager or a first-level manager, compared with 4% of men.”
			</p>
			<p>Race also has a large impact on disparities in wage.</p>
			<img src="/images/data.png" alt={`Statpage 8`} class="float-img" />

			<p>
				(Earnings Disparities by Race and Ethnicity, n.d.)
				In Michigan, where Jin and Ana live, the average for an Asian worker’s weekly earnings is $1,161, while that for a Hispanic/Latino person is at $744.78.

			<h2>Comparing numbers...</h2>
			<img src="/images/research2.png" alt={`Statpage 8`} class="float-img" />
			<p>
				Ana: "So basically, what this research is saying is that women trying to get top jobs often don't get support from inside their company because they're seen as risky choices, which makes it harder for them to move up."
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin: "And more successful female CEOs are more likely than male CEOs to be hired from outside their company, showing that women have fewer chances to get promoted from within."
				<br>
				<br>
				Ana: “And gender is not the only factor that affects salary. In Michigan, where we live, the average for an Asian worker’s weekly earnings is $1,161, while that for a Hispanic/Latino person is at $744.78.”
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin: “That means that the Asian worker earns $416.22 more than the Hispanic worker each week. This means that the Asian worker earns almost 22 thousand more than the Hispanic worker does each year.”
				<br>
				<br>
				Ana: "Wow, this is really unfair: Men get more help advancing their careers (aka sponsorship) from mentors than women do, even though both men and women get advice about their careers from mentors. Also, Asian workers earn so much more than Hispanic workers do, just because of their race."
				<br>
				<br>
				Jin: “This seems like a very big problem. Let’s meet tomorrow and do some more research on this issue.”

				As demonstrated in the graph, growth in women’s earnings has slowed in the past 2 decades. In the past 2 decades, the wage gap hasn’t really changed. As of 2022, a woman usually earns 82 cents for every dollar that a man earns(since 2002, this number has only increased by 2 cents), even despite the fact that women today have a higher likelihood of graduating college. (Kochhar, 2023)
				<br>
				<br>
				From 1982 to 2002, there was a significant amount of progress made in narrowing the wage gap. Women’s earnings increased from 65 cents for every dollar men made to 80 cents, which is a 15 cent increase. (Kochhar, 2023)

				1. The following section will explore the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all women and all men.
				Let’s look at the men as an example: 
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 1: Identify the median salary of all men: 1,202
				Step 2: Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Asian: |(Asian Median Salary )- (Median Salary for Men)| = |(1,635)-(1,202)| = 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Hispanic: |(Hispanic Median Salary)-(Median Salary for Men)| = |(915)-(1,202)| = 287
				<br>
				<br>
				Black: |( Black Median Salary) - (Median Salary for Men )| =|(970)-(1,202)|= 232
				<br>
				<br>
				White: | (White Median Salary)-(Median Salary for All Women)| = |(1,352)-(1,202)| = 150
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 3: Sort these 4 differences from least to most: 150, 232,  287, 433
				<br>
				<br>
				Step 4: Find the median of these differences, this will be your MAD:
				<br>
				<br>
				MAD =  (232+287)/2 = 259.5 
			</p>
			<h18>
			Now, use this process to find the MAD for all women:

			Identify the median salary of all women, and answer below:

			<br>
			Find the absolute value(the positive) differences between the median salary for each race and the median salary of all women identified in Step 1

While Jin and Ana eventually received equal salary, it was only because of their persistence and willingness to bring social change. Here are ways YOU can help raise awareness about wage gap in your community:</p>
			<li>
				Share this website to others in your community 
			</li>
			<li>
				Encourage students to research wage inequality further.
			</li>
			<li>
				Have students find their own examples of wage inequality and present their findings.
			</li>
			<li>
				Challenge students to think critically about the causes and effects of wage inequality.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inspire students to advocate for fair pay and equal opportunities for all
