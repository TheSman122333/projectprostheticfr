				<p>
				It was <b>October 2nd, 1998 in Kuwait City.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				Fahad stands at the window of his classroom, his gaze drifting over the bustling streets of Kuwait City. The sun cast a warm glow over the buildings, a stark contrast to the memories that haunted him from his childhood. The scars of war were still evident, as the city was slowly healing, just as he was.
				</p>
				He vividly remembers a time before the chaos, before the scars. "Life felt peaceful and full of promise," he thinks as he looks down at his arm solemnly remembering the trauma he endured. At the time he was but a schoolboy, just days away from the start of 5th grade, eager to play another season for his school's badminton team. Being one of the strongest members of his team he had been confident in his abilities but the afternoon of August 2nd,1990, that would all change.

			<h2>The Bombing.</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				“While having a joyful family gathering, the ground began to shake as we heard bombs and sirens overhead. Shortly after, the house came crashing down on us while we were eating" he recalled. It was a struggle to get out from under the bricks and rubble but the adrenaline in my body was so high that when we came out from the rubble, I hadn't even noticed that half my arm was missing until my mother ran up to me with concern and fear in her gaze. A shrapnel entered my arm during the bombing that night, leaving me permanently disabled. "In seconds, the life we knew was gone."
				</p>
				<p>
				The days that followed were a blur of fear and uncertainty. Our family was forced into a concentration camp. "We had no clean water, no clean clothes, no money," he remembered. We lived in a tent, while the war continued around us. There were no doctors, no support systems, and no access to prosthetics. As a child, I had to learn what it meant to live with a disability in the middle of a war zone.

			<h2>Going to College...</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				Now, as a college student, I have found ways to adapt. I can no longer play badminton so I decided the only way I could succeed was by focusing on my studies and hobby of tinkering with technology. I was often singled out, but Ayla, my childhood friend who was always like a sister to me, was always by my side.
				</p>
				<p>
				As of right now I am majoring in biochemistry, still trying to make my dreams of becoming a Neurosurgeon into a reality. With my amputated arm, I felt for a long time that these dreams were delusions. After tedious amounts of  research, I discovered that there is still hope for people like me when I found out a successful Orthopedic Surgeon in Kuwait was an amputee, and she became my inspiration. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Meanwhile, Ayla majored in Industrial and Operations Engineering, a blend of Business and Engineering, as she has a passion for both. One day, in her class, the professor invites a Biomedical Engineer to speak with the class about disability aid, that's when an idea sparked in Aylas head. She decides to make Fahad a prosthetic arm after realizing how hard it is for him to live without one, and that it could really help him out now that he has a closer accessibility to having one.

			<h2>Ayla wants to build a prosthetic...</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
					Ayla, with the help from her professor, created a very rudimentary prosthetic using EMG (ElectroMyography, it amplifies electrical signals in the muscles, and lets it become interpretable for microcontrollers). It was her first prosthetic, and its capabilities extended to it picking up cups and mugs. Ayla worked hard as she created the prosthetic. Unfortunately, it took a lot of trial and error for Ayla to custom fit my stub, especially because Ayla had to model and 3D print it multiple times. Ayla then presented this prosthetic to me. She was unsure when she showed me the prosthetic, as it was her first time building one, and told me that there was a risk with trying it on.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>

				After further research, Ayla and I noticed that there are a lot of countries and people that struggle from the lack of aid devices being distributed to those areas. For example, we saw a statistic made from South Dakota State University, they stated that out of 40 million people only two million of them have prosthetics.  As someone who has personally gone through this, this touched me deeply. So, we both made it our mission to start a company and solve this issue.

			<h2>Ayla's 3D printing journey!</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
				A few months later, Ayla tried to create a mold with 3D printing, in hopes of improving the older prosthetic Ayla’s Silicone Stub Socket™, surprisingly fit perfectly on my stub. This freed up a lot of time for me and Ayla, as she no longer had to custom fit the prosthetics to my stub, but now to the socket, and I could easily attach and remove prosthetics quickly. These prosthetics could also be swapped between users, as now it is only a magnetic fit, and the EMG technology was fit into the stub itself. Since it takes a long time to make the sockets fit the people so they can use the prosthetics, using molds makes it a lot easier.

I can finally play soccer again!” This interaction helped them both realize how many lives they have touched with the work they did.
